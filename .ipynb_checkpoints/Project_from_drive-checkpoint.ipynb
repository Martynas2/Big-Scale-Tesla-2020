    "Tableau Prep Builder is designed to help **ordinary people** quickly and confidently combine, shape, and clean their data for further analysis. It is a powerful tool for performing [data cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing), the process of turning data that is corrupt, partly missing or in other ways incoherent with your system (that is, [dirty data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_data)), into an intelligible and consitent format. \n",
    "\n",
    "Collected data in its raw format is rarely accurate, the causes for which are diverse. Sensors might malfunction, poorly implemented algorithms can cause system bugs and table irregularities, as can user mishandling. Data can be missing, out of boundaries, skewed, misplaced or even in the wrong format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do proper analysis of your raw data, you therefore need some knowledge of data prepping, and Tableau Prep Builder is an intuitive and adequate starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau Prep Builder allows you to clean the data by removing unwanted values, correct user mistakes and join different tables for further analysis. As a carrot on a stick we'll provide for you a snippet of code to perform a machine learning algorithm on the data if you manage to clean it properly. Stay tuned!\n",
